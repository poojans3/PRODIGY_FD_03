Task 3 â€“ Prodigy Infotech Internship

 ðŸš€ Project: Responsive Grocery Store Website (Frontend)

I recently completed Task 3 of my internship at Prodigy Infotech, where I built a modern and fully responsive grocery store website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project helped me improve my frontend development skills, especially in responsive design and JavaScript DOM manipulation. It was a great hands-on learning experience in building real-world user interfaces!
